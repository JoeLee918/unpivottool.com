UnpivotTool â€” Complete Guide

> UnpivotTool converts Excel tables with merged cells into tidy, analytics-ready rows. It preserves intentional blanks, expands merges safely, and lets you export clean CSV/XLSX.

## Who Is This For
Analysts, finance, operations, and anyone receiving Excel reports with merged headers or category bands.

## Problems We Solve
- Merged cells break copy/paste and formulas
- Wide tables are hard to analyze or chart
- Manual cleanup is slow and error-prone

## Core Flow
1) Paste or upload Excel/CSV
2) We detect vertical/horizontal merges and expand them (only fill true merge gaps)
3) Choose ID columns and Value columns
4) Export results or edit inline

## Key Behaviors
- Keep-true-blank: real empty cells stay empty
- Horizontal and vertical merge detection with safe heuristics
- Works with large tables; preview shows the first rows to keep UI responsive
